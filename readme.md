This is an extension of the working css3 Apple keyboard by [Dustin Cartwright](http://noxxten.com/). I originally found it from his [Forrst post](http://forr.st/~thx).

I've added the javascript that allows for typing by clicking the keys on the keyboard, a few lines of css to make a light on the caps lock key and I put the whole thing on HTML5Boilerplate.
